## Pre Session 3

Dear participants,

To prepare for our next session end of this week, I invite you to
follow up on the material I provide below.

# ML Project Checklist

When we started to work on the marketing use case, I invited you to first devise a plan and structure your approach.

I now encourage you to compare and contrast the following:
* Your project outline here: https://github.com/caichinger/AIMNC24/tree/main/use_case
* The project outline as suggested by the "ML project checklist" here: https://github.com/caichinger/AIMNC24/tree/main/supplements
* The domain specific questions, i.e. the framing of the problem, as discussed at the beginning of chapter "3 Linear Regression" in the book "Introduction to Statistical Learning" (https://www.statlearning.com/). You find a copy of the respective pages in the supplements folder.


# Project Outline

Once you have done the above, how about your project, i.e. the Paillasse use case?


# Code on GitHub / Google Colab

As said, all code is on GitHub: https://github.com/caichinger/AIMNC24

You can open and run the code examples in Google Colab and I invite you to do that in order to familiarized yourself with the environment.


# Start Coding

If you haven't started to play around with the Data Camp courses or Google Colab, I suggest you give it a try.


# Asking the Right Questions

The topic of our next session is "Asking the Right Questions".

Are there any questions you would like to ask?
If so, write them down and we give them a try.



Looking forward to our next session,
Kind regards,
Claus
