## Pre Session 4

Dear participants,

Next week's coaching session is an important milestone in your projects and we invite you to prepare well to get the most out of this session.


# What to prepare?

The better you are prepared, the more we will be able to support your efforts.

What you can do to be prepared:
* Have draft version of your project plan ready:
  * Frame the big picture.
  * Clearly outline business objective and related consideration with regards to modelling.
  * Sketch your approach.
  * Consider our ML project checklist.
* Have a draft version of your ML pipeline ready:
  * How could a minimal version look like?
    * Once that is there, we have something to work on. You can test your assumptions.
    * Use that minimal version to play through your use case. You can later still improve your model.
    * Don't let the perfect be the enemy of a small step in the right direction.
  * What are the necessary steps?
  * Are there specific, technical details that you need help with?


# Hints & Code Snippets

We collected a few hints and snippets here:

If you are already running into technical issues, consider reaching out by mail to share your problem.



Looking forward to working with you,
Kind regards,
Thomas & Claus


## Pre Session 3

Dear participants,

To prepare for our next session end of this week, I invite you to
follow up on the material I provide below.

# ML Project Checklist

When we started to work on the marketing use case, I invited you to first devise a plan and structure your approach.

I now encourage you to compare and contrast the following:
* Your project outline here: https://github.com/caichinger/AIMNC24/tree/main/use_case
* The project outline as suggested by the "ML project checklist" here: https://github.com/caichinger/AIMNC24/tree/main/supplements
* The domain specific questions, i.e. the framing of the problem, as discussed at the beginning of chapter "3 Linear Regression" in the book "Introduction to Statistical Learning" (https://www.statlearning.com/). You find a copy of the respective pages in the supplements folder.


# Your Project Outline?

Once you have done the above, how about your project, i.e. the Paillasse use case?


# Code on GitHub / Google Colab

As said, all code is on GitHub: https://github.com/caichinger/AIMNC24
* Includes our discussion notes
* Includes source code
* Includes supplementary material

You can view the examples on GitHub.

You can view and run the examples in Google Colab and I invite you to do that in order to familiarized yourself with the environment.


# Time to Start Coding

If you haven't started to play around with the Data Camp courses or Google Colab, I suggest you give it a try.


# Asking the Right Questions

The topic of our next session is "Asking the Right Questions".

Are there any questions you would like to ask?
If so, write them down and we give them a try.



Looking forward to our next session,
Kind regards,
Claus
